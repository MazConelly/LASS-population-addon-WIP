# LASS population addon WIP

Two mods for Stalker Anomaly add female NPCs: Women of the Zone and Dux's Innumerable Character kits. But their selection is limited to Hip clones and SEVAs.

LASS is an addon for War Nymph, intended to let you play as female. And for 3rd person camera, it reworked vanilla models into female ones. But they're only used by the player. We're talking everything from novice jackets to nosorogs, in every faction.
This project intends to take those LASS models, and add them to the NPC spawn pool.


Requirements:

-LASS: https://github.com/Paint-Thinner/Ladies-and-Sister-Stalkers-LASS

-War Nymph: https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/war-nymph


Done:

-character_desc_general files. You should find female loners at every rank for every faction.

-Models fixed to provide NPCs the correct protection.

-Missing LASS models.

-Death_outfits.ltx file. NPCs should drop the respective outfit to their model.


To do:

-Proper name files.

-Proper audio. Anomaly has its default female set for Hip, but that's not enough.

Women of the Zone has an ecolog_f set we could use. LASS also has an addon for either English or Russian voice, but I haven't checked if they're ready to use for NPCs.

-Make sure the the models have all their textures. I think they did in OGF Editor but the texture folder I settled for it didn't have all vanilla textures.


Maybes:

-Service NPCs. Techs, traders, etc. We can fill the gaps like WotZ did in the Dark Valley bandit HQ with a female medic, but the rest is harder as there are already named NPCs. Maybe make them take turns with something like Semi Radiant AI?

-Named NPCs. This includes non-service NPCs: guards, task givers, roaming stalkers... for fleshing out the population.

-Mod patches. This depends on the mod and extension of the patching. Duty Expansion could have Anna use one of the LASS models as asked by someone else, for consistency reasons. Kolin could be patched so half the LCS wearing female mercs use its model.
