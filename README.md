# LASS population addon WIP

Two mods for Stalker Anomaly add female NPCs: Women of the Zone and Dux's Innumerable Character kits. But their selection is limited to Hip clones and SEVAs.

LASS is an addon for War Nymph, intended to let you play as female. And for 3rd person camera, it reworked vanilla models into female ones. But they're only used by the player. We're talking everything from novice jackets to nosorogs, in every faction.
This project intends to take those LASS models, and add them to the NPC spawn pool.


Requirements:

-LASS: https://github.com/Paint-Thinner/Ladies-and-Sister-Stalkers-LASS

-War Nymph: https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/war-nymph


Done:

-Loner character_desc_general file. You should find female loners at every rank.

-Models fixed to provide NPCs the correct protection.

-Death_outfits.ltx file. NPCs should drop the respective outfit to their model.


To do:

-character_desc_general files for all other factions.

-Proper name files.

-Proper audio. Anomaly has its default female set for Hip, but that's not enough.

Women of the Zone has an ecolog_f set we could use. LASS also has an addon for either English or Russian voice, but I haven't checked if they're ready to use for NPCs.

-Make sure the the models have all their textures. I think they did in OGF Editor but the texture folder I settled for it didn't have all vanilla textures.


Maybes:

-Service NPCs. Techs, traders, etc. We can fill the gaps like WotZ did in the Dark Valley bandit HQ with a female medic, but the rest is harder as there are already named NPCs. Maybe make them take turns with something like Semi Radiant AI?

-Named NPCs. This includes non-service NPCs: guards, roaming stalkers... for fleshing out the population.

-Tasks. Simply as a way to justify those NPCs. The only current idea is this one: https://discord.com/channels/456765861953536020/1385377776118530058/1385382734993559714

-Mod patches. This depends on the mod. Duty Expansion could have Anna use one of the LASS models as asked by someone else, for consistency reasons.

-????
