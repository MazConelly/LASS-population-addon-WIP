# LASS population addon WIP

Two mods for Stalker Anomaly add female NPCs: Women of the Zone and Dux's Innumerable Character kits. But their selection is limited to Hip clones and SEVAs.

LASS is an addon for War Nymph, intended to let you play as female. And for 3rd person camera, it reworked vanilla models into female ones. But they're only used by the player. We're talking everything from novice jackets to nosorogs, in every faction.
This project intends to take those LASS models, and add them to the NPC spawn pool.


Requirements:

- LASS: https://github.com/Paint-Thinner/Ladies-and-Sister-Stalkers-LASS

- War Nymph: https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/war-nymph


Current features:
- Female stalkers should spawn at every rank for every faction.
- Models fixed to provide NPCs the correct protection (at least as far as the current vanilla limits allow).
- Missing LASS models: ISG SKAT, eco radsuit, Sin protoexo.
- Death_outfits.ltx file. Female NPCs should drop the respective outfit to their model.
- Duty Expansion patch: Anna can be assigned the more vanilla like IBAZ or SKAT models.
- Kolin patch: half the mercs in LCS will use the Kolin model.

Current stopgag measures:
- One model replacement, and placeholder name and voice sets files taken from Women of the Zone by Karelian. Credits to them. https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/women-of-the-zone

To do:
- Proper name files.
- Proper voice sets.
- Model fixing. They have two issues: increased number of materials, and use of non-vanilla textures. Ideally the materials would be reduced, but I'm unskilled in Blender. Changing textures is tedious and vanilla textures may be of lower quality, but it'd be preferable to require assets from other mods.


Maybes:
- Service NPCs. Techs, traders, etc. We can fill the gaps like WotZ did in the Dark Valley bandit HQ with a female medic, but the rest is harder as there are already named NPCs. Maybe make them take turns with something like Semi Radiant AI?
- Named NPCs. This includes non-service NPCs: guards, task givers, roaming stalkers... for fleshing out the population.
- Mod patches. This depends on the mod and extension of the patching.
- ????
