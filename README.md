# LASS population addon WIP

You probably know of the mods Women of the Zone and Dux's Innumerable Character kits. Both add female NPCs, but their selection is limited to Hip clones and SEVAs.
LASS is an addon for War Nymph, intended to let you play as female. And for 3rd person camera, it reworked vanilla models into female ones. But they're only used by the player. We're talking everything from novice jackets to nosorogs, in every faction.
This project intends to take those LASS models, and add them to the NPC spawn pool.

Given the nature of the project and my pitiful computer, I'd appreciate anyone that is willing to help who uses LASS, preferibly with a non-low population faction (at least 0.5, maybe 1.0). You only need to install the current project and see how it works and feels, or how it doesn't and what.

What you need:
-War Nymph: <https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/war-nymph>
-LASS: <https://github.com/Paint-Thinner/Ladies-and-Sister-Stalkers-LASS>
-The project: https://drive.proton.me/urls/SGPZP9NR1M#14snb2T0zQLz


Current state of the project:
-Loner character template file. You should find female loners at every rank.
-Fixed models to provide NPCs with the correct protection.
-Death_outfits.ltx file finished. NPCs should drop the respective outfit to their model.


To do:
-All other factions.
-Proper audio. Anomaly has its default female set for Hip, but that's not enough.
Women of the Zone has an ecolog_f set we could use. LASS also has an addon for either English or Russian voice, but I haven't checked if they're ready to use for NPCs.
-Make sure the the models have all their textures. I think they did in OGF Editor but the texture folder I settled for it didn't have all vanilla textures.

Maybes:
-Service NPCs. Techs, traders, etc. We can fill the gaps like WotZ did in the Dark Valley bandit HQ with a female medic, but the rest is harder as there are already named NPCs. Maybe make them take turns with something like Semi Radiant AI?
-Named NPCs. This includes non-service NPCs: guards, roaming stalkers... for fleshing out the population.
-Tasks. Simply as a way to justify those NPCs. The only current idea is this one: https://discord.com/channels/456765861953536020/1385377776118530058/1385382734993559714
-Mod patches. This depends on the mod. Duty Expansion could have Anna use one of the LASS models as asked by someone else, for consistency reasons.
-????
